Unfortunately, Dr. FunFrock found it and built his fortress right over it, although the Rock was supposed to be indestructible! I would dig a tunnel for you so that you could enter the building, but you must first sabotage the Teleportation Center. Go find the plans of this center, I can dig only after all the telepods have been neutralized!"

As we can only act from the heart of the planet, we implanted a lineage of elected creatures among the species living on the surface. You are the current descendant of this family, and when FunFrock's threat had become too great, it was me that called to you in your dreams. The entity can now finish its gestation because you rid us of FunFrock. It would have died if he had gotten to it, and this world would have imploded, thanks to you it will continue to flourish. Return now to the surface, you can now erase the final traces that he left there."
